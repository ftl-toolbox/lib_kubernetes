# lib_kubernetes

This is the future home of the auto-generated/wrapper library for supporting upstream Ansible Kubernetes Modules.

Current work is being done in [lib_openshift](https://github.com/ftl-toolbox/lib_openshift) and once things stabilize, this repository will be updated with a fork for supporting just the kubernetes APIs.
